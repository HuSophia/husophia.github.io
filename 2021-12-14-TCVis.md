Researchers and scientists gain critical insights into hurricanes by analyzing their tracks using data from leading weather agencies like the National Hurricane Center (NHC), NOAA, and NASA. 
Hurricane tracks reveal essential information about the storm's life cycle, including its trajectory, forward speed, intensity fluctuations, and landfall points. 
For instance, hurricanes tend to follow paths influenced by the Earth's rotational forces and atmospheric conditions, curving due to the Coriolis effect. 
By studying these patterns, scientists can identify common routes and behaviors. Research published in the <em>Journal of Climate</em> has shown that shifts in hurricane tracks over recent decades are linked to changes in atmospheric circulation patterns, likely influenced by climate change (Kossin et al., 2014). 
This knowledge enables scientists to improve predictive models, helping emergency managers and policymakers develop more effective preparedness and response strategies for future hurricanes. 
Understanding the evolution of a hurricane's intensity, such as rapid intensification before landfall, is particularly crucial for protecting vulnerable coastal communities.

Unfortunately, there are limited open-source software options available that provide scientists and emergency managers with easy-to-use tools for analyzing tropical cyclone data. One notable Python package, [Tropycal] (https://tropycal.github.io/tropycal/index.html), offers a streamlined approach to retrieving and visualizing tropical cyclone data.
It facilitates the quick generation of visualizations using data from key datasets such as HURDAT, IBTrACS reanalysis, and National Hurricane Center Best Track data (Fig. 1).

While Tropycal is highly beneficial, it lacks certain features that could enhance its utility. For instance, the tool does not currently display the dates associated with each data point along the cyclone's track, which is critical for understanding the temporal context of the stormâ€™s movement. 
Additionally, it would be advantageous to include information on the maximum sustained wind speeds and minimum sea level pressure (SLP) at each point along the cyclone's path. 
This data is readily accessible from various weather agencies, and incorporating it into the visualizations would create a more comprehensive and informative graphic. 
Such enhancements would be invaluable to scientists, emergency managers, and other stakeholders in making informed decisions during hurricane events.

Recognizing these gaps, I developed a data visualization tool for NOAA scientists that builds on the foundational concepts used in tools like Tropycal but offers more detailed insights into the lifecycle of hurricanes.
This code is designed to create visualizations of hurricane tracks using data from the IBTrACS (International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship) dataset. The user inputs the name and year of a specific storm, and the code generates a detailed plot of the storm's path, including key information such as wind speeds, pressure, and wind radii. The code relies on several libraries, including Cartopy for map projections, Matplotlib for plotting, and Pandas for data manipulation.
The core functionality is encapsulated in functions that perform specific tasks. The LonTo360() function converts longitudes from the -180 to 180 range to the 0 to 360 range, ensuring consistency in plotting. The get_by_name() function filters and extracts relevant storm data from the IBTrACS dataset based on the provided storm name and year, returning a DataFrame with essential information like latitude, longitude, wind speeds, and pressure. The draw_quadrants_arcs() function visualizes the storm's wind radii by drawing arcs on the map at different quadrants, showing the extent of the storm's influence in various directions.
In the main part of the code, the user specifies the storm name, year, and the path to the IBTrACS dataset file. The code then processes the data to create a map using Cartopy, with coastlines, borders, and gridlines, and adjusts the map's extent based on the storm's geographical data. It iterates through each time step of the storm, plotting its position on the map, drawing arcs for wind radii, and annotating the plot with details such as wind speed, pressure, and timestamp. The final visualization is saved as a PNG file named after the storm and year.
The design of this code is modular, with functions dedicated to specific tasks, making it easy to maintain and extend. 
It allows for high customization of the map and visualization, making it flexible for various use cases.
Potential improvements could include optimizing the code for readability, adding error handling, and enhancing the visualization with features like color-coded tracks based on wind speed categories. Overall, this code effectively creates detailed and informative visualizations of hurricane tracks.
