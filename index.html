<body>  
<p>I obtained my B.Sc. in Mathematics-Statistics from the University of Maryland, College Park. My research interests span machine learning, statistics, and AI for science. 
Through internships at NOAA, NASA, and in the pharmaceutical industry, I gained experience developing software for data visualization, automating data processes, and conducting statistical analysis. 
Collaborating with scientists, I worked to enhance the accuracy and accessibility of environmental and clinical dataâ€”experiences that deepened my commitment to using data science for social impact.

<p>Outside of work, I enjoy community volunteering, creating <a target="_blank" href="https://sophytravels.pixieset.com/gallery/df26175426/">art</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://sophytravels.pixieset.com/gallery/">photography</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/sohu">running</a>, playing <a target="_blank" href="https://sophytravels.pixieset.com/gallery/2a7e579174/">basketball</a>, and taking walks with my dog.</p>
