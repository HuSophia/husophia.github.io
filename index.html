<p>I am a senior at the University of Maryland, College Park studying mathematics-statistics and computer science. My research interests include data science, machine learning, and database systems. Currently, I am working with Dr.Battle on the optimization of visualization recommender systems. </p>
<p> I am also open to opportunities in software engineering and data analyst roles, where I can apply my skills and knowledge in mathematics, statistics, and computer science to solve real-world problems and contribute to innovative projects.
