<body>  
<p>I obtained my B.Sc. in Mathematics-Statistics with a minor in Computer Science from the University of Maryland, College Park.
My research interests encompass data science, machine learning, statistics, and database systems.
Previously, I interned at NOAA and NASA, where I developed software for data visualization, automated processing, and statistical analysis, collaborating with scientists to improve the accuracy and usability of environmental and climate data.
These experiences deepened my passion for using data science to drive positive social impact.</p>

<p>In my leisure time, I enjoy volunteering in the community, creating <a target="_blank" href="https://sophytravels.pixieset.com/gallery/df26175426/">art</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://sophytravels.pixieset.com/gallery/">photography</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/sohu">running</a>, playing sports like <a target="_blank" href="https://sophytravels.pixieset.com/gallery/2a7e579174/">basketball</a>, and taking walks with my dog, Honey.</p>
