<body>  
<p>I obtained my B.Sc. in Mathematics-Statistics with a minor in Computer Science from the University of Maryland, College Park.
My research interests encompass data science, machine learning, statistics, and database systems.
Previously, I’ve interned at NOAA, NASA, and pharmaceutical companies, developing software for data visualization, automating processing, and statistical analysis. Working alongside scientists, I contributed to improving the accuracy and accessibility of environmental and clinical data—experiences that fueled my passion for using data science to drive social impact.</p> 

<p>In my leisure time, I enjoy volunteering in the community, creating <a target="_blank" href="https://sophytravels.pixieset.com/gallery/df26175426/">art</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://sophytravels.pixieset.com/gallery/">photography</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/sohu">running</a>, playing sports like <a target="_blank" href="https://sophytravels.pixieset.com/gallery/2a7e579174/">basketball</a>, and taking walks with my dog, Honey.</p>
