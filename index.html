Currently, I am working with Dr.Battle at the UW Interactive Data Lab on the optimization of visualization recommender systems. </p>

<p>In my spare time, I enjoy playing games, <a target="_blank" href="https://sophytravels.pixieset.com/sophytravels/">photography</a>, sports (basketball, badminton, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/sohu">running</a>, swimming),and taking walks with my dog (Honey). </p>
