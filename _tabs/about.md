I am a senior at the University of Maryland, College Park studying mathematics-statistics and computer science. My research interests include data science, machine learning, and database systems. Currently, I am working with Dr.Battle at the UW Interactive Data Lab on the optimization of visualization recommender systems.

In my spare time, I enjoy photography, running, swimming, watching anime, and taking long walks with my dog (Honey).
